# Rows-Matching-Case
This database has 2 datasets - data1 and data2. The Primary Key for both data1 and data2 is Order ID + Product ID combination (i.e. the individual datasets do not have any duplicate on this combination). Apart from Order ID text and Product ID text, both the data tables have one additional column each, i.e., Qty int.
