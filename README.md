# Rows-Matching-Case
This database has 2 datasets - data1 and data2. The Composite Key for both data1 and data2 is Order ID + Product ID combination (i.e. the individual datasets do not have any duplicate on this combination). Apart from Order ID text and Product ID text, both the data tables have an additional column Qty int. This project further delves into four specific objectives listed as follows:
1. To identify the records (Order ID + Product ID combination) present in data1 but missing in data2
2. To identify the records (Order ID + Product ID combination) missing in data1 but present in data2 
3. To find the sum of the total quantity of records missing in data1 but present in data2
4. To find the total number of unique records (Order ID + Product ID combination) present in the combined dataset of data1 and data2
